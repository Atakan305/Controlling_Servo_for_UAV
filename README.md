# Controlling_Servo_for_UAV

As a team, we competed in Teknofest, Turkey's most comprehensive technology and competition festival 
and I led the software department for one year in that team. So, due to our tasks, We needed to control 
the 5 servo motors to maneuver the UAV and to orient the UAV to the detected object. 

And as you see codes, servo motors have to connect with camera to sense the movement and orient the UAV. 
So, here are 3 projects about connection between servo motors-camera, object detection-orientation and acted autonomous with these tasks.
